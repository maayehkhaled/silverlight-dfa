This is a simple simulation of a deterministic finite automaton written in c# for silverlight.

This was a project for our studies course "Informationpr√§sentation". A running example can be tried at http://wanderer.site50.net/SilverlightApplication6.html. But be aware that you will need Silverlight 4 to do so.

The project is finished now, so do not expect any updates.
